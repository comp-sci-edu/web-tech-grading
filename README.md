## Principles

Applying a traditional memorize and test approach to teaching web design and development is doomed to failure because:

* Web technology is too vast. HTML has hundreds of elements and attributes. CSS has thousands of properties. JavaScript is an entire programming language...
* Web technology changes frequently. New things are added, old things are deprecated. There are entire initiatives to keep track of all of this ([caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)).
* Design (including web design) is fundamentally about creativity and synthesis.
* Creating websites involves integrating many different technologies and techniques rather than making small, disconnected units.

Further, grading work or any type of metrics based incentivization, is detrimental to creative work. It leads to metrics fixation and inferior performance. It also creates a "cap" which students are likely to stay below. With open-ended, project based work students can and do dramatically exceed the minimum requirements and turn work that is representative of their true capabilities.

## Approach

When teaching web design, the best approach I have found thus far:

* Instructors should tend toward live coding rather than traditional lecture.
* The futility of intentional memorization in the web design space should be emphasized. It's good for students to see that instructors look things up in docs frequently.
* The difference between reference documentation and tutorials/guides should be explained. References give excessive detail, tutorials/guides demonstrate integration of techniques and technologies toward a goal.
* Assignments should be project based work of the students choosing (resume website, personal interest website, etc.).
* Collaboration between students should be encouraged throughout class. However, on most assignments each student should turn in their own project, even if they worked as a group i.e. 3 students working in a group will turn in 3 separate projects.
* Discuss the difference between copying code snippets to create a certain component or achieve a certain look and actual plagiarism which is copying of content.
* Show students how to find and use CSS frameworks, HTML components, free image assets, and free icons and artwork.
* Licensing terms and attribution are important. Have students demonstrate how and where to find terms and evaluate whether they are compatible with their project.
