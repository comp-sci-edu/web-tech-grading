# Web Technology Grading

A collection of resources to assist with the automation of grading project-based assignments. Initially created for _Internet/Web Development Level I (CIS133DA)_ at Gateway Community College.

## Principles

Applying a traditional memorize and test approach to teaching web design and development is doomed to failure because:

* Web technology is too vast. HTML has hundreds of elements and attributes. CSS has thousands of properties. JavaScript is an entire programming language...
* Web technology changes frequently. New things are added, old things are deprecated. There are entire initiatives to keep track of all of this ([caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)).
* Design (including web design) is fundamentally about creativity and synthesis.
* Creating websites involves integrating many different technologies and techniques rather than making small, disconnected units.

Further, grading work or any type of metrics based incentivization, is detrimental to creative work. It leads to metrics fixation and inferior performance. It also creates a "cap" which students are likely to stay below. With open-ended, project based work students can and do dramatically exceed the minimum requirements and turn work that is representative of their true capabilities.
