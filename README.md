# Web Technology Grading

A collection of resources to assist with the automation of grading project-based assignments. Initially created for _Internet/Web Development Level I (CIS133DA)_ at Gateway Community College.

## Principles

Applying a traditional memorize and test approach to teaching web design and development is doomed to failure because:

* Web technology is too vast. HTML has hundreds of elements and attributes. CSS has thousands of properties. JavaScript is an entire programming language...
* Web technology changes frequently. New things are added, old things are deprecated. There are entire initiatives to keep track of all of this ([caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)).
* Design (including web design) is fundamentally about creativity and synthesis.
* Creating websites involves integrating many different technologies and techniques rather than making small, disconnected units.

Further, grading work or any type of metrics based incentivization, is detrimental to creative work. It leads to metrics fixation and inferior performance. It also creates a "cap" which students are likely to stay below. With open-ended, project based work students can and do dramatically exceed the minimum requirements and turn work that is representative of their true capabilities.

## Approach

When teaching web design, the best approach I have found thus far:

* Instructors should tend toward live coding rather than traditional lecture.
* The futility of intentional memorization in the web design space should be emphasized. It's good for students to see that instructors look things up in docs frequently.
* The difference between reference documentation and tutorials/guides should be explained. References give excessive detail, tutorials/guides demonstrate integration of techniques and technologies toward a goal.
* Assignments should be project based work of the students choosing (resume website, personal interest website, etc.).
* Collaboration between students should be encouraged throughout class. However, on most assignments each student should turn in their own project, even if they worked as a group i.e. 3 students working in a group will turn in 3 separate projects.
* Discuss the difference between copying code snippets to create a certain component or achieve a certain look and actual plagiarism which is copying of content.
* Show students how to find and use CSS frameworks, HTML components, free image assets, and free icons and artwork.
* Licensing terms and attribution are important. Have students demonstrate how and where to find terms and evaluate whether they are compatible with their project.

## Grading

The most difficult aspect of implementing the above in a traditional educational setting is keeping grading effort manageable.

In today's classroom, Learning Management Systems (LMS) are common. Most LMSs tend to have built-in quiz, test, and other automated grading features that can drastically reduce the amount of time and effort spent by teachers. Reducing unnecessary work for teachers is critically important to ensure that their limited time is spent on higher impact planning and instruction of students.

In order to meet the above goals while keeping grading time manageable on heterogenous student projects, it's important to automate as much of the grading process as possible. Fortunately, modern web development tooling is robust allowing us to automate most code quality assessments without forcing students to all work on clones of the same project.
